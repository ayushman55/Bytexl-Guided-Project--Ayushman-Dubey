Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Algorithm:
1.	Data Acquisition:
Identify and select a suitable bike-sharing dataset from a reliable source (e.g., public repositories, APIs, or bike-sharing operators).
Download or access the dataset and import it into your chosen programming environment.

2.	Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and data types.
Identify and handle missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, removal).
Detect and address outliers or inconsistencies in the data.
Convert data types as needed (e.g., dates, categorical variables).
3.	Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from the existing data, such as:
Temporal features: hour of the day, day of the week, month, season, holiday.
Weather features: temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation.
Location features: station coordinates, nearby landmarks, population density.
Create new features based on domain knowledge and data analysis, such as:
Interactions between existing features (e.g., temperature and hour of the day).
Time-lagged features (e.g., previous hour's demand).
Aggregated features (e.g., average demand for a specific station on weekdays).
4.	Feature Selection:
Select the most relevant features for predicting bike demand using techniques like:
Correlation analysis: Identify features that are strongly correlated with demand.
Feature importance scores: Use machine learning models to rank features based on their contribution to prediction accuracy.
Domain expertise: Consider factors known to influence bike demand based on prior knowledge and research.
5.	Data Splitting:
Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
The training set is used to train the machine learning model.
The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during training.
The testing set is used for final evaluation of the model's generalization ability on unseen data.
6.	Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for regression tasks, considering factors like:
Data characteristics: linear vs. nonlinear relationships, presence of outliers.
Model complexity: trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.
Computational resources: training time and memory requirements.
Potential models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and neural networks.
7.	Model Training:
Train the selected model on the training data using appropriate optimization techniques.
Monitor the model's performance on the validation set during training to prevent overfitting.
Adjust hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and generalization.
8.	Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): average absolute difference between predicted and actual demand.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual demand.
R-squared: proportion of variance in demand explained by the model.
9.	Model Deployment (Optional):
If desired, deploy the trained model as a web service or API for real-time demand prediction.
This allows bike-sharing operators to integrate the model into their systems for operational decision-making.
10.	Communication and Visualization:
Create visualizations and reports to summarize the project's key findings and insights.
Present the project results to stakeholders, explaining the methodology, model performance, and implications for bike-sharing operations.
